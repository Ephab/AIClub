welcome friends

i do not have an openai api key so i have no idea whether this program works at all or not
so good luck i guess

to run this program make sure to do the following in your python env:

pip install openai
pip install praw
pip install streamlit


afterwards dont forget to enter your own api keys and credentials in main.py

then in the terminal run this command: streamlit run "path to main.py on your computer"
make sure to change the path to where you have cloned this repo or where the main.py file exists.
